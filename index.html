It was first released in Japan on December 17, 2011. It primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles. This console has sooOooOO much potential to be the greatest portable console game ever. But sadly this console didn't even close from his older brother PSP at sales. PS Vita has many exclusive games, incredible features its like this device is from the future. Way ahead of its time. I think I know what the problem is. The PS Vita memory card slot is only compatible with a special Vita memory card, which is much more expensive than the others, so it's difficult to have many games on this console.</p>
